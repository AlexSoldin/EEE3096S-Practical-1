# EEE3096S-Practical-1

This practical acted as an introduction into basic embedded systems using a Raspberry Pi 3. 

Using basic circuitry, the task was to develop a simple 3-bit binary counter. The values of which will be placed on LEDs 
connected to the Pi. The value on the counter should change depending on a button press on two seperate push buttons 
(one increment and one decrement).
