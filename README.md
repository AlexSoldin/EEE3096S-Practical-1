Using basic circuitry, the task was to develop a simple 3-bit binary counter. The values of which will be placed on LEDs 
connected to the Pi. The value on the counter should change depending on a button press on two seperate push buttons 
(one increment and one decrement).

The hardware used was a breadboard, 3x LEDs, 3x 10kÎ© resistors and 2x push buttons.
